## Harvesting, cycling, soccer fan!

- When I am not spending time doing science I like to spend time with my family, Tessa, Dante Simon, Kush, Athena and Lola (in Mexico City with la abuela), drink a cold beer and harvest some vegs!
- I love to go cycling to the University enjoying the outstanding ladscapes of Vancouver. If itÂ´s raining I like to ride the bus and read a book. 
- I like to travel, specialy in the country-side, know new places and people!

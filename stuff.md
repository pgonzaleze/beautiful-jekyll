## Harvesting, cycling, soccer fan!

- When I am not doing science I like to spend some time with my family, Tessa and Dante Simon, and our pets, Kush, Athena and Lola (in Mexico City with la abuela), drink a cold beer and harvest some veggies!
- I love to go cycling to the University enjoying the outstanding landscapes of Vancouver. If itÂ´s raining I like to ride the bus and read a book. 
- I like to travel, especially in the country-side, know new places and people!
- I exercise my neurons learning Dutch, so far I know arround 500 words, Goed zo!

## Harvesting, cycling, soccer fan!

- When I am not doing science, I like to spend time with my wife Tessa, pre-schooler and baby sons, and our pets, Kush, Athena and Lola (in Mexico City with la Abuela), drink a cold beer and harvest some veggies!
- Rain or shine I love to cycle to the University enjoying the outstanding landscapes of Vancouver.  
- I like to travel, especially in the country, getting to know new places and people!
- Wat is Koraalverbleking en hoe erg is het? I am learning Dutch but I find it a bit difficult.
- I love to cook, and if it is from the garden to the table, even better! My favourite dish is chilaquiles with "tatemada" charred sauce.
- I play the diatonic harmonica!

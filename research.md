## Main 
My interest is centred in the study of the relationship between the distinct environmental factors with the stability of marine ecosystems, using remote sensing as the major tool.

## Ongoing
My current research is focused on analysing the past, to understand how coral reef ecosystems have been able to cope with the environmental variability to which they have been exposed. And thus enabling, through numerical models, to predict their future fate.

## Areas of expertise 
 * Remote sensing on coral reefs 
 * Multiple stressors  
 * Sustainability and management

## Programming languages used
 * R
 * Python

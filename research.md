## Main 
I’m interested in studying the relationship between distinct environmental factors and the stability of marine ecosystems using remote sensing as a key tool.

## Ongoing
My current research is focused on analysing the past to understand how coral reef ecosystems have been able to cope with the environmental variability to which they have been exposed. This might allow us, through numerical models, to predict their future fate.

## Areas of expertise 
 * Marine Ecology
 * Multiple stressors on marine ecosystems  
 * Sustainable management 
 * Multivariate analyses 

## Tools
 * Python
 * R Project for Statistical Computing
 * Climate Data Operators (CDO)
 * ArcGIS 
 * QGIS

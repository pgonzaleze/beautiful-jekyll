## Have you ever describe yourself? Yes, it is a tough one!

I was born in the majestic Mexico City, I raised in by one of the purest urban environments you can imagine. Just there I decided to turn my life and start giving my first scientific steps far away home. 

I moved to La Paz BCS to study marine biology at my alma mater the Universidad Autonoma de Baja California Sur. I joined the Reef Systems Lab, led by Dr Reyes-Bonilla (HÃ©ctor), where I aimed to study the Trapezia crab, that lives between the corals, but circumstantially, an unusual coral bleaching event hit the reefs caught my attention and I described it in my thesis dissertation.

I decided to further my studies doing more reef stuff related, so I entered the graduate program at Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas del Noroeste. I was fellow at the Nekton and Reef Ecology Lab, led by Dr Balart-Paez, where I analysed the skeletal traits of the emerald coral, Porites panamensis, finding for the first time a sex-related dimorphism, in corals, and a possible environmental interference. 

I am currently doing my PhD at the Coastal and Climate Ecosystem Lab of the University of British Columbia where I have the honour to be guided by Dr Donner (Simon), and where I am aiming to develop an algorithm that helps to understand past events and predict the future ones over reef ecosystems.
